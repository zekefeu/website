Hi, I'm Zeke! I'm a french software developer specializing in Node.js.

I've made this blog to talk about my *many* ongoing projects, as well as programming-related stuff, gaming, DIY and more generally, what's on my mind, especially when it wouldn't belong in a more compact [Mastodon](/about/) post.

I'm 17 years old and I have 4 years of experience with Node.js, as well as 2 years in TypeScript and Linux. I'll post my resume here at some point.

Currently, I'm studying software development and system administration. That includes languages like Java, C#, PHP and C++, as well as a lot of other network-related tools and technologies. Additionally, I also want to learn other languages like Rust, Go and others.

As a non-binary individual, I am part of the LGBT community.
I'm open to discussing related stuff with open-minded people, but coming at me trying to disrespect me, bully me, or trying to make fun of my identity and/or my sexual orientation is a complete and utter waste of time.

## Xe

This website is *heavily* inspired by [Xe's blog](https://xeiaso.net). It is in fact, the blog that has made me want to make my own.
I've actually wanted to make a *minimalist* website like that for a long time (this isn't really my first shot at it either), and xer blog was just exactly what I wanted to have, so here we are!

I'll try to implement more stuff in the future to make it more unique, but it's still at a pretty early stage, and I want to get this website out as fast as possible.

## This website

I'm going to talk about how I've made it in a later post, but here are some key objectives I set myself: privacy, speed and minimalism. My goal is to make as simple of a website as possible, while still being able to introduce dynamic stuff later down the road.

More posts are on the way. I won't stick to a specific schedule, but I'll try to post at least once or twice a month.

For now, that's all I have to say.
We might learn a thing or two along the way, we'll see how it goes!
